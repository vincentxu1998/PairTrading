Note on the installation of the database of ETF names that helps run ReversionYesLoopMod_DISTRIBUTED.py

ReversionYesLoopMod_DISTRIBUTED.py has a line that refers to a database of ETF names called PythonData.db:

#set the database file path we wish to connect to
#this will obviously be unique to wherever you created
#the SQLite database on your local system
database = 'C:\sqlite\PythonData.db'

as you can see above, the PythonDabta.db is supposed to be in a directory called sqlite in the C directory. 
Go ahead and setup the sqlite directory within the C directory and copy and paste the PythonData.db flat file there.
That is all you need to be able to run ReversionYesLoopMod_DISTRIBUTED.py

However you can do more.
If you install DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.10.1-win64.exe (you just need to double-click it) you will be able
to open the PythonData.db and look into its tables.
So go ahead and install DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.10.1-win64.exe 
Once you install it, run Programs> DB Browser for SQL lite
Press Open Database
Browse to and select C:\sqlite\PythonData.db
Select etftable (or etftable2, they are very similar) inside the Database Structure tab
Select the tab Browse Data
you will see the contents of the table
For example if you want to see all the currency ETFs, just press the column Asset Class and in the filter write Currency
or just press the column Asset Class and the asset classes will organize alphabetically and Currency will appear in the expected order


You do not need to install anything else but if you want you can install sqllite also
this will enable you to create other sqllite databases
for this purpose, I have included sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3240000.zip and sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3240000.zip
